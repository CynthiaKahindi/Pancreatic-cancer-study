# Pancreatic cancer study in Kenyatta National Hospital(Kenya)

# Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is among the most common causes of death due to cancer worldwide.  Cases have been increasing worldwide and this review has analyzed the most recent incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer occurrence in Kenyatta National Hospital(KNH). Several possible risk factors have been analyzed in this analysis, involving known established risk factors and new possible risk factors. 
The development of this cancer is a stepwise progression through intraepithelial neoplasia(STAGE 1) to carcinoma(STAGE 4). Though early and accurate diagnosis is promising based on a combination of recent techniques including tumor markers and imaging modalities, lacking early clinical symptoms makes the diagnosis late.

# Description
In other forms of cancer,early detection has been proven to increase the survival rate of patients.This study seeks to investigate the likelihood of increasing the survival rate in pancreatic cancer patients

# Motivation
This project aims to sensitize the country to prioritize cancer screening eventhough they may not exhibit symptoms. This project was done as pre-requisite for an assessment of a data science course

# Summary of analysis
1.Defining the question 
2.Reading the Data 
3.Checking the Data 
4.Performing Univariate,Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis 
5.Creating visualizations 
6.Challenging the solution 
7.Conclusion and Recommendations

# Tools Required
Python libraries for example Seaborn,numpy ,Pandas and sklearn are required for the analysis.

# Setup
The most efficient way of uploading and running the code is using google colab or jupyter notebook.Importing libraries from pandas is also a priority.
